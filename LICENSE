copyright

Create a new file and give it the name of the CNAME you want (in my case it's rem.json). This file contains a JSON object containing at least a copyright property:

{
  "copyright": “天气网, https://tianqi.com"
}

Means I can now link to https://rem.mit-license.org and it will show my license name (note that the date will always show the current year).

You can also use an array to hold multiple copyright holders:

{
  "copyright": ["天气网"]
}
